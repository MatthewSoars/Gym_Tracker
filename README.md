# Gym Tracker
Gym Tracker to show the day's workout and provide a way of keeping track of which workouts you have completed in your routine.

## Proposal
Keeping track of your daily gym workouts when following a routine typically involves the use of a paid app or notes software, which must be constantly updated.  
Therefore, the idea behind this tracker is to show the day's workout automatically and allow the user to tick them off as they go through their routine.

### Initial Design

As seen above, the initial design is simple, which is intentional in order to make it easy to use, even when in a state of exercise-induced delirium post-workout. I have included both a desktop and a phone version as it is important to consider that, although I am developing on a desktop device, I will be using this on my phone (iPhone 16 Pro). Within Figma, I have captured my exact device measurements. 

Design-wise, device size is important because, in the initial builds of my website, I will be using HTML/CSS, which by default is unresponsive to device size. Therefore, it is important to design for my target device as it would be weird to carry a laptop round the gym.
