Gym Tracker to show days workout and provide a way of keeping track what workouts you have completed out of the routine

## Proposal
Keeping track of your days gym work when using a routine typically involves the use of a paid app or notes software which has to be constantly edited.  
Therefore the idea behind this tracker is to show the day's workout automatically, then allow the user to tick them off as they go along their routine.
